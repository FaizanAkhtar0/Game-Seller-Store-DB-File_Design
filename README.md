# Game-Seller-Store-PHP-BootStrap-JS
This a modern UI game seller store made in PHP and BootStrap. I used this project to test a custom product recommender API.

The file was too big so download at(project source): https://www.mediafire.com/file/qo22kzpkcsjhgaf/Project.rar/file
1) Setup XAMPP server and place extracted project folder in "htdocs".
2) Config "httpd.conf" as <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/Project">
3) You can either try uploading previous data along with database in .sql file or if it's producing errors just copy create table and alter table commands from it.
3.1) The "web db design.vsdx" contains db design in ms visio. Create your own db using that in case if step 3 didn't work out for you.
